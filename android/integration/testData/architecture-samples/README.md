# Android Architecture Samples

These samples showcase different architectural approaches to developing Android apps. In its different branches you'll find the same app (a TODO app) implemented with small differences.

In this branch you'll find:
*   User Interface built with **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)** 
*   A single-activity architecture, using **[Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)**.
*   A presentation layer that contains a Compose screen (View) and a **ViewModel** per screen (or feature).
*   Reactive UIs using **[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)** and **[coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations.
*   A **data layer** with a repository and two data sources (local using Room and a fake remote).
*   Two **product flavors**, `mock` and `prod`, [to ease development and testing](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/12/leveraging-product-flavors-in-android.html).
*   A collection of unit, integration and e2e **tests**, including "shared" tests that can be run on emulator/device.
*   Dependency injection using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).

## Variations

This project hosts each sample app in separate repository branches. For more information, see the `README.md` file in each branch.

### Stable samples - Kotlin
|     Sample     | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [main](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/main) | This branch |
| [service-locator](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/service-locator) | A simple setup that removes Hilt in favor of a service locator |
| [livedata](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/livedata) | Uses LiveData instead of StateFlow as the data stream solution |
| [usecases](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/usecases) | Adds a new domain layer that uses UseCases for business logic (not using Compose yet) |
| [views](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/views) | Uses Views instead of Jetpack Compose to render UI elements on the screen |
| [views-hilt](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/views-hilt) | Uses Views and Hilt instead together |

## Why a to-do app?

The app in this project aims to be simple enough that you can understand it quickly, but complex enough to showcase difficult design decisions and testing scenarios. For more information, see the [app's specification](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/wiki/To-do-app-specification).

## What is it not?
*   A template. Check out the [Architecture Templates](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates) instead.
*   A UI/Material Design sample. The interface of the app is deliberately kept simple to focus on architecture. Check out the [Compose Samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples) instead.
*   A complete Jetpack sample covering all libraries. Check out [Android Sunflower](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-sunflower) or the advanced [GitHub Browser Sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/GithubBrowserSample) instead.
*   A real production app with network access, user authentication, etc. Check out the [Now in Android app](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) instead.

## Who is it for?

*   Intermediate developers and beginners looking for a way to structure their app in a testable and maintainable way.
*   Advanced developers looking for quick reference.

## Opening a sample in Android Studio

To open one of the samples in Android Studio, begin by checking out one of the sample branches, and then open the root directory in Android Studio. The following series of steps illustrate how to open the [usecases](tree/usecases/) sample.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:android/architecture-samples.git
```
This step checks out the master branch. If you want to change to a different sample: 

```
git checkout usecases
```

**Note:** To review a different sample, replace `usecases` with the name of sample you want to check out.

Finally open the `architecture-samples/` directory in Android Studio.
