/**
 * A [JfrReportGenerator] handles processing the JFR events and creating the report text for a single
 * crash report. A [Capture] represents a time interval of interest, for which this generator will
 * receive events to process. In the case of an [AggregatingJfrReportManager], multiple Captures may
 * occur during the lifetime of the generator (though they must not overlap).
 *
 * Start and end offsets can be used to adjust the capture interval relative to the actual times of
 * the calls to startCapture and stopCapture. This can be useful to, for example, adjust the start
 * time of a freeze capture, given that it takes some time to detect that a freeze is occurring.
 * Negative start offsets must be shorter than the length of one recording chunk ([JFR_RECORDING_DURATION]).
