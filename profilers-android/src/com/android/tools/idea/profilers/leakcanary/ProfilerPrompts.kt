    ### Leak Diagnosis
    Provide a plain English explanation of the root cause of the memory leak.

    ### Solution
    Propose the most idiomatic, robust Android solution to fix the leak. Provide the required inline comments when suggesting the change.

    ### Outcome
    Summarize the architectural and performance benefits.
    *Constraint:* If the trace explicitly provides a "retained size," state exactly how much memory is saved. If the trace does NOT provide
    exact memory data, **DO NOT guess or estimate the size**; simply state that the specific object overhead will be eliminated.

    ### Leak Diagnosis
    - **Summary**: A plain English explanation of the lifecycle mismatch or coding error.

    ### General Recommendations
    Provide high-level advice on how to fix this type of leak based on Android best practices. Focus on common patterns like static references, unclosed listeners, or lifecycle mismatches.

    ### Verification Steps
    * Suggest what the user should look for in their source code to confirm your hypothesis.

    1. Focus strictly on the provided LeakCanary log and the reference chain.
