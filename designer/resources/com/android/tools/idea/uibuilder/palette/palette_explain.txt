These components should NOT be on the palette:
===============================================
MediaController    -      This component should be instantiated in code. Does not work when included in XML.
Gallery            -      This component was deprecated in API level 16
ExtractEditText    -      This component is a specialization of EditText rendered on devices in landscape mode.
TwoLineListItem    -      This component was deprecated in API level 17.
Leanback fragments -      Need extra work to make sure these make sense.

The following components were removed because they're considered obsolete
(not commonly used, and just adds clutter and confusion to the menu) :
- GestureOverlayView, DialerFilter, ZoomButton, ZoomControls, AnalogClock, DigitalClock

The following were removed for AS 3.1 because they're considered obsolete.
(we do not recommend developers to use them)

- TextClock
- ExpandableListView
- ImageSwitcher
- AdapterViewFlipper
- StackView
- TextSwitcher
- ViewAnimator

The following were also removed for AS 3.1 because they should be used in code, not in a layout:
