/**
 * Class that contains a value of type [T] that is lazily initialized. This class allows for code
 * that does not support coroutines yet to interoperate with lazy loaders. Initially, this class
 * will return [beforeLoadValue] until a new value has been loaded. Usually, on a first invocation
 * to [getCachedValueOrUpdate], the method will return [beforeLoadValue] and trigger a new load. The
 * load will happen by invoking the [loader] method using the [loadingScope]. Once the [loader] has
 * completed, [onValueLoaded] will be invoked with the new value. [onValueLoaded] is guaranteed to
 * only be invoked once. [loader] can be invoked multiple times so, it's important for the method to
 * not have side effects.
