/**
 * An interaction is a mouse or keyboard driven user operation, such as a swipe-select or a resize.
 * It can be thought of as a session, since it is initiated, updated during user manipulation, and
 * finally completed or canceled. An interaction can have at most one undo transaction (some
 * interactions, such as a selection do not have a transaction), and an interaction can have a
 * number of graphics [Layer]s which are added and cleaned up on behalf of the interaction by the
 * system.
 *
 * [Interaction] uses [InteractionEvent] as its event interface so all events can be used to start,
 * update, end, or cancel. The implementation of [Interaction] has to cast the received
 * [InteractionEvent] to its acceptable event type such like [KeyTypedEvent], [MousePressedEvent],
 * [MouseWheelEvent], [DragEnterEvent], [DragOverEvent], or [DropEvent] to perform the [begin],
 * [update], [commit], and [cancel] operations. This makes [Interaction] able to handle more than
 * one kind of event. For example, a drag interaction can also handle the [KeyPressedEvent] during
 * dragging. So it can apply different behavior when the modifiers are pressed or released during
 * interacting.
