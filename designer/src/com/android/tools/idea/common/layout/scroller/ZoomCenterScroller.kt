/**
 * When the view size is changed, the new center position should have same weight in both x-axis and
 * y-axis as before. Consider the size of the view is 1000 * 2000 and the zoom center is at (800,
 * 1500). So the weight is 0.8 on x-axis and 0.75 on y-axis. When view size changes to 500 * 1000,
 * the new center should be (400, 750) because we want to keep same weights We calculate the new
 * viewport position to achieve above behavior.
