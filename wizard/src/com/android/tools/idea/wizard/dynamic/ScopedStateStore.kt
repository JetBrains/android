/**
 * Used by [DynamicWizard], [DynamicWizardPath], and [DynamicWizardStep] to store their state.
 * Each state store is part of an ancestry chain of state stores. Each level of the chain has a scope associated with it.
 * The ancestry chain must be ordered in value order of scopes, that is the scope's ordinal value must increase as the chain
 * of stores is traversed upwards from child to parent. Each stored value is associated with a scope, and values are only stored
 * in a store of the same scope as the value. If a given store is asked to store a value of a different scope, it will pass the value
 * up the chain until a store of appropriate scope is found. When searching for a value, each store will first search in its own value
 * map before inquiring up the chain, so keys of a lower scope will "shadow" the same keys which have higher scopes.
 *
 * The store can have a listener associated with it which will be notified of each update of the store.
 * The update will contain the key associated with the change as well as the scope of the change.
 * The store also allows for pulling change notifications rather than these pushed notifications via the
 * [recentUpdates] and [clearRecentUpdates].
 *
 * The currently defined scopes are STEP, PATH, and WIZARD. So, each DynamicWizardStep has a ScopedStateStore associated with it which
 * has a scope of STEP, which only stores key/value pairs which also have a scope of STEP.
 * The store declares a [Key] class which must be used to store and retrieve values. A Key is parametrized with the class of the
 * associated value. Each Key has a Scope. A null scope may be used if the client does not care where the data associated with the
 * Key is retrieved from or stored. If a scope is specified, then calling get() will only return a value with a matching scope.
 *
 * ## Choosing Scopes
 * Most keys should be scoped at the PATH level, since they are shared with the rest of that modular workflow.
 * Each instance of DynamicWizardPath maintains its own ScopedStateStore instance. If you wish a key to be shared between
 * multiple paths then it should be scoped at the WIZARD level. A STEP scoped key is only available to the instance object of the
 * STEP in which it is registered, and thus behaves like a local variable.
