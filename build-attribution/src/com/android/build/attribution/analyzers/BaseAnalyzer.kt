 * The general flow for each analyzer would be:
 * 1) collect all data required from events and other input sources in internal variables.
 * 2) convert this collected data into a final result object in [calculatingResult] when requested.
 * 3) clean up collected temporal data in [cleanupTempState], called automatically when data is no more needed.
