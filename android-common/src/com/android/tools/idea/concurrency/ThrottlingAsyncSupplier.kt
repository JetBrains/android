/**
 * A caching [AsyncSupplier] which ensures an expensive-to-compute value isn't computed more than once in
 * a set period. It makes sense to use a [ThrottlingAsyncSupplier] when you expect [AsyncSupplier.get]
 * to be called more frequently than what's reasonable given time or resource constraints.
 *
 * [ThrottlingAsyncSupplier] works by delaying computation in order to merge rapid successions of
 * [AsyncSupplier.get] requests. It guarantees that the computed value reflects the state of the world
 * at or after the time that [AsyncSupplier.get] was called. This is in contrast to [CachedAsyncSupplier],
 * for which [AsyncSupplier.get] may return the future corresponding to an already in-progress computation.
