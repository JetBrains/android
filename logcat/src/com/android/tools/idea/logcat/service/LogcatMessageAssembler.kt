/**
 * Receives batches of lines from an `adb logcat -v long` process and assembles them into complete
 * [LogcatMessage]'s.
 *
 * A logcat entry starts with a header:
 *
 * `[ 1650901603.644 1505: 1539 W/BroadcastQueue ]`
 *
 * And is followed by one or more lines. The entry is terminated by an empty line but there is
 * nothing preventing users from including an empty line in a proper message so there is no reliable
 * way to determine the end of a Logcat entry. The only reliable trigger that an entry has ended is
 * when a new header is parsed.
 *
 * This means that the last entry cannot be assembled until the next entry is emitted, which could
 * cause an unwanted delay.
 *
 * To avoid this delay, after finishing precessing a batch of lines, we schedule a delayed task to
 * flush the last message if nothing arrives in time.
 *
 * Note: This is flaky by definition but given the Logcat ambiguous format, it's the best we can do.
 *
 * This class is derived from the old `com.android.tools.idea.logcat.AndroidLogcatReceiver` which
 * has since then been deleted.

 * about converting \n's to \r\n's, including those that are quoted. This means that a user's log,
 * if it uses \r\n itself, is converted to \r\r\n. Then, when MultiLineReceiver, which expects valid
 * input, strips out \r\n, it leaves behind an extra \r.
 *
 * Unfortunately this isn't a case where we can fix the root cause because adb and logcat are both
 * external to Android Studio. In fact, the latest adb/logcat versions have already fixed this
 * issue! But we still need to run properly with older versions. Also, putting this fix in
 * MultiLineReceiver isn't right either because it is used for more than just receiving logcat.
