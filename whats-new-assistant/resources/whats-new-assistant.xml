            <p>To ensure your app icon looks its best when users enable "Theme icons" in Android 16,
            Android Studio now lets you preview how your icon will look with the new theming
            algorithm. Use this new preview tool to get an idea of how your icon will look and
            identify any potential color contrast issues.</p>

            <p>Android Studio now uses the same user configurations across canary, beta, and stable
            releases. As a result, "Preview" has been dropped from the configuration directory path
            for preview releases. We've also added a micro version to the config directory path. For
            example, <code>AndroidStudio2024.3.2</code> is <code>AndroidStudio2024.3</code>.</p>

            <p>Gemini in Android Studio's new Prompt Library feature enhances productivity by
            allowing you to save and manage frequently used prompts. Access the Prompt Library
            from <b>Settings &gt; Gemini &gt; Prompt Library</b> to store and retrieve prompts. You can also
            right-click on a prompt in chat to save it for later use. To apply a saved prompt,
            right-click in the Editor and navigate to <b>Gemini &gt; Prompt Library</b> to apply the prompt.
            This streamlined workflow eliminates the need to retype commonly used prompts, saving
            developers time and effort.</p>
