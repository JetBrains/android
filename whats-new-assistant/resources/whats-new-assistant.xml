            <p><a href="https://developer.android.com/identity/data/backup">Android Backup and
            Restore</a> enables your app to back up app data and restore it either on to a new
            device or after a fresh install. In Android Studio, you can now more easily generate a
            backup of your app data saved to local storage and restore that data on to a test device.
            </p>
            <p>
            This not only makes it much easier to test your app's support for backup and restore,
            but also accelerates your development workflow by helping you set up a new device, or
            install with the sample data and configurations you need to develop and debug your app.

            <a href="https://d.android.com/develop/ui/compose/tooling/previews">Compose Preview</a>
            helps you visualize your composables during design time in Android Studio.
            To make it easier for you to include mock data as preview parameters, Android Studio
            supports an experimental feature: Compose preview generation with Gemini.</p>
            <p>To access this tool, right-click any composable and navigate to <b>Gemini >
            Generate "Composable Name" Preview</b>, or when the current file doesn't have any
            previews, right-click and navigate to <b>Gemini > Generate Compose Preview
            for this file</b>.</p>
            <p>While Gemini's generated code may not be perfect every time, it helps provide a
            valuable starting point to accelerate your development workflow.</p>
