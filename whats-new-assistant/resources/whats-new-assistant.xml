            The UI for the CPU Profiler has been overhauled to provide a more intuitive workflow. Some notable changes include:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>CPU recordings are now separated from the main profiler timeline to allow for easier analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recorded data are organized in groups on the left side of the Profiler window. You can move groups up and
                down to reorganize the list.
              </li>
              <li>For easier side-by-side analysis, you can now view all thread activity in the thread activity
              timeline. To expand a specific thread and view its activity, double-click the thread in the
              timeline.

            <li>Events are now uniquely colored for easier differentiation.
            </li>
            <li>Threads are sorted by the number of trace events within them so that the “busier” threads
            are ranked higher in the list.
            </li>
            <li>You can select one or more threads to see analysis in the righthand column for those
            selected threads only. Clicking on an event also displays analysis of the
            selected event in the righthand column.

            Through a process called <em>desugaring</em>, you can now use a number of Java 8
            language APIs without requiring a minimum API level for your app. This means that you
            can now include standard language APIs that were available only in recent Android
            releases (such as <code>java.util.streams</code>) in apps that support older versions of Android.

            Android Gradle plugin 4.0.0-alpha01 and higher now support Kotlin DSL build script files
            (<code>*.kts</code>). When using Android Studio, certain IDE features, such as the
            Project Structure dialog and build script quick fixes, now also support reading and
            writing to Kotlin build script files.

            The editor also integrates with your Android Studio project to provide full symbol
            completion for all classes, methods, and fields, and includes quick navigation
            and refactoring.

            <br><br>
            For example, a feature module for taking videos can depend on another feature that
            enables camera functionality. So, when your app requests to download the video feature,
            the app also downloads the camera feature module.
