            <![CDATA[
            <p>Provide custom prompts for Gemini in Android Studio to generate code suggestions. You
            can ask Gemini to simplify complex code by rewriting it, perform very specific code
            transformations such as "make this code idiomatic," or generate new functions you
            describe. Android Studio then shows you Gemini's code suggestion as a code diff, so that
            you can review and accept only the suggestions you want.

            <p>Use Gemini in Android Studio to analyze your App Quality Insights crash reports,
            generate insights, provide a crash summary, and when possible recommend next steps,
            including sample code and links to relevant documentation. Generate all of this
            information by clicking <b>Show Insights</b> in the <b>App Quality Insights</b> tool
            window in Android Studio after you enable Gemini from
            <b>View > Tool Windows > Gemini</b>.

            <![CDATA[
            <p>Android Studio now includes a new sensor panel, which lets you simulate a device
            having or not having specific sensor capabilities, such as a heart rate sensor, as well
            as set specific test values for these sensors. Use this panel to test how your app
            handles devices that have different sensor capabilities. This panel is useful for
            testing health and fitness apps, especially on Wear OS devices.
