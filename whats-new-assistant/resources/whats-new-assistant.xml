             <br /><br />
              <p>
                Logcat has been updated to make it easier to parse, query, and keep track of logs.
                This represents the most significant update to the tool since its introduction, and
                we welcome you to <a href="http://issuetracker.google.com/createIssue?title=%5BLogcatV2%5D+Title&cc=adarshf%40google.com%2Crpaquay%40google.com&format=PLAIN&component=192708&type=BUG&priority=P1&severity=S2&assignee=aalbert%40google.com&inProd=true">provide
                feedback</a>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>New formatter:</b> Logcat now formats logs to make it easier to scan useful
              information, such as tags and messages, and identify different types of logs, such as
              warnings and errors.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>Create multiple Logcat windows:</b> You can now create multiple tabs within Logcat,
              so that you can easily switch between different devices or queries. Right-clicking a
              tab allows you to rename it, and you can click and drag to rearrange the tabs.
              Additionally, to help you more easily compare between two sets of logs, you can now
              split the view within a tab by right-clicking in the log view and selecting either
              <b>Split Right</b> or <b>Split Down</b>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <b>Switch between view presets:</b> Logcat now allows you to quickly switch between
                different view modes (<b>Standard</b>, <b>Compact</b>, and <b>Custom</b>) by clicking
                <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/2021.3.1/logcat-view-modes-button.png">.
                Each view mode provides a different default setting for showing you more or less
                information, such as timestamps, tags, and process IDs (PID). You can also customize each of
                these default view modes, as well as a custom view mode, by selecting <b>Modify View</b>.
            </p>
              <br><img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/2021.3.1/logcat-view-selection.png"></p>
              <br><br>
            <p>
              <b>New key-value search:</b> We've now simplified the search experience by introducing
              key-value searches right from the main query field, complete with suggestions, history,
              and the ability to favourite queries.
            </p>
              <br><img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/2021.3.1/logcat-query-auto-complete.png"></p>
              <br><br>
            <p>
              Here are some examples of how to use the new query system, but you can also simply
              start typing in the query field to see suggestions:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li><b>PIDs for the local app project:</b> <code>package:mine</code>
              </li>
              <li><b>Specific values:</b> <code>package:my-package-ID</code>, <code>tag:my-tag</code>,
              <code>level:ERROR</code>, and more.
              </li>
              <li><b>Exclude a specific value</b> by preceding the key with <code>-</code>:
              <code>-tag:exclude-this-tag</code>.
              </li>
              <li><b>Use regular expressions</b> with a given key by placing a <code>~</code> after the key:
              <code>tag~:regex-tag</code> or <code>-tag~:exclude-this-regex-tag</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>You can also see a history of queries by clicking
            <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/2021.3.1/logcat-query-history.png">
            in the query field and selecting them from the drop down. To favorite a query so that it
            stays at the top of the list across all your studio projects, click the
            <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/2021.3.1/logcat-favourite.png">
            at the end of the query field.
            </p>
              <br><img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/2021.3.1/logcat-history.png"></p>
              <br><br>
            <p><b>Track logs across app crashes/restarts:</b> The new Logcat now makes it easier to
            track logs from your app across app crashes and restarts, so that you don't miss important
            logs across these events. When a Logcat notices that your app process has stopped and
            restarted you'll see a message in the output similar to below:
            </p>

            Discover, investigate, and resolve issues reported by Crashlytics in Android Studio and

            navigate from crashes to code (and from code to crash), and surfaces important
            contextual data about each crash to help you reproduce issues locally. If your app
            project already includes the Crashlytics SDK, get started by selecting
            <b>View &gt; Tool windows &gt; App Quality Insights<b> from the main menu.

               Minimize the number of interruptions when developing by streaming your device display
               directly to Android Studio. Device Mirroring gives you the ability to interact with a
               physical device using the <b>Running Devices</b> window in Studio. To enable this feature,
               go to <b>Preferences > Experimental</b> and check the box next to <b>Device Mirroring</b>.
               Once enabled, connect your device and either deploy your app or open the
               <b>Running Devices</b> window to begin streaming the device's display and interacting
               with it from the IDE.

              Recompositions are highlighted to help you determine where in the UI your composables
              are recomposing. The highlighted portion shows a gradient overlay of the composable in
              the image section of the Layout Inspector, and gradually disappears so that you can
              get an idea of where in the UI the composable with the highest recompositions can be
              found. If one composable is recomposing at a higher rate than another composable, then
              the first composable receives a stronger gradient overlay color.

              View a summary of time spent downloading dependencies and a detailed view of downloads
              per repository using Build Analyzer. You can use this information to determine whether
              unexpected dependency downloads are negatively impacting your build performance-for
              example, during incremental builds, which shouldn't consistently download artifacts.
              You can also use this information to identify configuration issues, such as use of
              dynamic versions of dependencies that cause unexpected downloads.If you see a high
              number of failed requests for a specific repository, it could indicate that the
              repository should be removed or moved lower in your repository configuration.
