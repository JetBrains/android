              Instrumentation tests can now be run
              across multiple devices in parallel and investigated using a specialized
              instrumentation test results panel. Using this panel, you can determine if
              tests are failing due to API level or hardware properties.

              <br><br>Testing your app across a wide variety of API levels and form factors is one
              of the best ways to ensure that all users have a great experience when using your app.

              is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. The toolkit also brings all of
              Kotlin's benefits, such as helping you to write concise and idiomatic code that's
              fully interoperable with Java.
              <br><br>
              When using Android Studio to develop your app with Jetpack Compose, you benefit from
              smart editor features, such as a New Project template, code completion enhancements,
              and a live preview of your Compose UI.
