            <![CDATA[
            As part of <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/android-studio-35-beta.html">Project Marble</a>,
            this update focuses on improving stability, memory leaks, and hangs, and improvements to
            core user features. Some of these improvements are described below.
            <br><br>
            <b>Memory management settings</b><br><br>
            <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/3.5.0/memory-settings-wna.png"
            width="428"
            alt="The memory settings, which let you configure maximum amount of RAM for Android
            Studio processes." />
            <br><br>
            If you use a 64-bit operating system that has at least 5 GB of RAM, you can now
            configure the maximum amount of RAM that your OS should allocate for Android Studio
            processes, such as the core IDE, Gradle daemon, and Kotlin daemon.
            <br><br>
            You can access these new settings by selecting <b>File > Settings</b> (or
            <b>Android Studio > Preferences</b> on macOS), and then finding the
            <b>Memory Settings</b> section under <b>Appearance & Behavior > System Settings</b>.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <b>Memory usage report</b><br><br>
            <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/3.5.0/memory-usage-report-wna.png"
            width="428"
            alt="The memory settings, which let you configure maximum amount of RAM for Android
            Studio processes." />
            <br><br>
            Memory problems in Android Studio are sometimes difficult to reproduce and report. To
            help solve this problem, Android Studio now includes a memory usage report that you can
            send to the Android Studio team to help identify the source of memory issues.

            <b>Windows: Antivirus file I/O optimization</b>
            <br><br>
            To help you optimize you antivirus software configuration, Android Studio now automatically
            checks whether certain project directories are excluded from real-time antivirus scanning
            and notifies you.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <b>App deployment flow</b>
            <br><br>
            The IDE has a new drop-down menu that lets you quickly select which device you'd
            like to deploy your app to. This menu also includes a new option that lets you
            run your app on multiple devices at once.

            <br><br>
            <b>Improved Gradle sync and cache detection</b>
            <br><br>
            To avoid Gradle sync errors, the IDE now downloads missing dependencies when it detects that
            Gradle has cleared its build cache.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <b>Improved support for Data Binding</b>
            <br><br>
            In addition to adding incremental annotation processing support for Data Binding, the IDE
            improves smart editor features, such as performance when creating data binding expressions in
            XML.
            <br><br>
            <a href="https://d.android.com/studio/releases?utm_source=android-studio-3-5&utm_medium=studio-assistant-stable#3-5-data-binding">

            <br><br>
            <b>Improved support for C/C++ projects</b>
            <br><br>
            Android Studio now supports installing multiple versions of the NDK. And, with Android Gradle
            plugin 3.5.0 or higher, you can specify the version of the NDK each module in your project
            should use.

            <br><br>
            Additionally, you can improve Gradle sync performance by selecting the ABI you want the editor
            to use. To do so, select select <b>Build</b> &gt; <b>Select Build Variant</b> in the menu bar
            and, for each module in your project, select the ABI from the <b>Active ABI</b> column.
            <br><br>

      <step label="Apply Changes">
        <stepElement>
          <section>
            <![CDATA[
            Apply Changes lets you push code and resource changes to your running app without
            restarting your app—and, in some cases, without restarting the current activity. Apply
            Changes implements a completely new approach for preserving your app’s state by
            leveraging the runtime instrumentation supported in Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher.
            <br><br>
            To use Apply Changes, do the following:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>If you want to apply only your code changes without restarting the current activity,
             click <b>Apply Code Changes</b>&nbsp;
             <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/3.5.0/toolbar-apply-code-changes.png" width="19" height="19" />.
             <br><br>
             Generally, you should use <b>Apply Code Changes</b> if you have modified code in the
             body of a method but you have not modified any resources.
            </li>
            <li>If you want to apply your resource and code changes without restarting your app,
             click <b>Apply Changes and Restart Activity</b>&nbsp;
             <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/releases/assistant/3.5.0/toolbar-apply-changes.png" width="19" height="19" />.
             This option lets you apply resource and code changes by restarting the current activity
             without restarting your app.
            </li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>
            <b>Enable Run fallback</b><br>
            You can configure Android Studio to automatically <b>Run</b> your app again whenever
            your changes can't be applied. To enable these settings, follow these steps:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
            <li>Select <b>File > Settings</b> (or <b>Android Studio > Preferences</b> on macOS).</li>
            <li>Navigate to <b>Build, Execution, Deployment > Deployment</b>.</li>
            <li>Check the boxes to enable automatic Run fallback for either of the Apply Changes
            actions.</li>
            <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
            </ol>

            Android app bundles now support conditional delivery, which allows you to set certain
            device configuration requirements—such as, device hardware or software features, user
            country, and API level—to determine whether a device should automatically download a
            dynamic feature module at app install.

            Android Studio 3.5 includes several improvements to layout visualization, management, and
            interaction, such as the following:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>When working with <code>ConstraintLayout</code>, a new
              <b>Constraints</b> section in the <b>Attributes</b> panel lists the constraints relationships
              of the selected UI component.</li>
              <li>You can now delete a constraint by selecting it and pressing the Delete key.</li>
              <li>When a view is selected, you can create a constraint by clicking on any of the <b>+</b> icons in the <b>Constraint Widget</b> section of the <b>Attributes</b> panel</li>
              <li>When creating a constraint, the Layout Editor now shows only the eligible anchor points
                to which you can constrain.</li>
            </ul>
