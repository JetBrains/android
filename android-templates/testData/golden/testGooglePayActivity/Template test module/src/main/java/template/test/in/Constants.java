/**
 * This file contains several constants you must edit before proceeding.
 * Please take a look at PaymentsUtil.java to see where the constants are used and to potentially
 * remove ones not relevant to your integration.
 *
 * <p>Required changes:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Update SUPPORTED_NETWORKS and SUPPORTED_METHODS if required (consult your processor if
 *      unsure)
 * <li> Update CURRENCY_CODE to the currency you use.
 * <li> Update SHIPPING_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES to list the countries where you currently ship. If this
 *      is not applicable to your app, remove the relevant bits from PaymentsUtil.java.
 * <li> If you're integrating with your {@code PAYMENT_GATEWAY}, update
 *      PAYMENT_GATEWAY_TOKENIZATION_NAME and PAYMENT_GATEWAY_TOKENIZATION_PARAMETERS per the
 *      instructions they provided. You don't need to update DIRECT_TOKENIZATION_PUBLIC_KEY.
 * <li> If you're using {@code DIRECT} integration, please edit protocol version and public key as
 *      per the instructions.
