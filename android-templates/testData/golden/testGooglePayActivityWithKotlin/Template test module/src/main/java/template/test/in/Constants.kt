/**
 * This file contains several constants you must edit before proceeding.
 * Please take a look at PaymentsUtil.java to see where the constants are used and to potentially
 * remove ones not relevant to your integration.
 *
 *
 * Required changes:
 *
 *  1.  Update SUPPORTED_NETWORKS and SUPPORTED_METHODS if required (consult your processor if
 * unsure)
 *  1.  Update CURRENCY_CODE to the currency you use.
 *  1.  Update SHIPPING_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES to list the countries where you currently ship. If this
 * is not applicable to your app, remove the relevant bits from PaymentsUtil.java.
 *  1.  If you're integrating with your `PAYMENT_GATEWAY`, update
 * PAYMENT_GATEWAY_TOKENIZATION_NAME and PAYMENT_GATEWAY_TOKENIZATION_PARAMETERS per the
 * instructions they provided. You don't need to update DIRECT_TOKENIZATION_PUBLIC_KEY.
 *  1.  If you're using `DIRECT` integration, please edit protocol version and public key as
 * per the instructions.
