"""
The test_project_package macro and rules supporting it.

test_project_package generates a set of targets contributing to the
:integration_test_data rule that produces the testdata directory representing
prebuilt artifacts that are required to simulate the query sync process in
the CI environment. This reflects the following constraints imposed by the CI
and Bazel.

(a) No network access - i.e. no direct access to the source code repository and
    thus no way to run `bazel query` and `bazel build` on projects with real
    dependencies.

(b) No wildcards in list of labels attributes - i.e. test_project_package
    requires all targets in the package to be listed manually. However, because
    `siblings()` function is available in `genquery` rules, this list can be
    verified and build fails if any targets that matter are missing from the
    list

(c) Wildcards except `siblings()` function are not supported in `genquery`
    rules - .i.e. //package/path/... queries run by the query sync need to be
    replaced with  manually expanded lists of targets

(d) Aspects used from rules cannot have string parameters - means
    collect_dependencies aspect is replaced with collect_all_depdencies_for_tests
    aspect sharing the same implementation function but applying include/exclude
    filers. Instead, filtering is applied when artifact_info_file are loaded
    by the query sync integration test framework.

The test data directory consists of the following major groups of files.

(1) sources - includes all source files in a test project including any
    subpackages that also need to be described with test_project_package. Note:
    build fails if such a description is missing.

(2) prebuilt dependencies - outputs of the collect_depdencies aspect for all
    targets and their dependencies in this package. Note that unlike queries
    that run in the production, `genquery`ies cannot contain wildcards and
    therefore include/exclude filters are not applied at this stage. However,
    this is not different form bazel populating bazel-out with this files during
    normal build. When artifact_info_file files are loaded they are properly
    filtered to include only the required artifacts.

(3) artifact_info_file files - outputs of package_dependencies aspect for all
    targets and their dependencies in this package. Unlike the query sync in the
    production include /exclude filters are not applied at this stage.
    artifact_info_file are filtered when loaded by the query sync integration
    test rules.
    TODO(b/271858575): Consider filtering pre-built query results by
    include/exclude during build.
