/**
 * A BlazeProjectSystemProvider determines whether or not a BlazeProjectSystem would be applicable
 * for a given project. If so, the provider is responsible for creating the instance of
 * BlazeProjectSystem that should be associated with the project.
 *
 * <p>We provide this functionality in BlazeProjectSystemProvider instead of having
 * BlazeProjectSystem implement AndroidProjectSystemProvider itself because there are times when we
 * want to instantiate the provider extension without creating a new instance of the project system.
 * In particular, the provider extension may be instantiated after the disposal of the project, in
 * which case we can't create the project system because it interacts with the project during
 * instantiation.
