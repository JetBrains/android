   * This flow represents the App Insights state of a host Android app module.
   *
   * The state includes:
   * * Active and available [Connection]s of a project.
   * * Active and available issues of the app(crashes).
   * * Active and available filters used to fetch the above issues.
   *
   * It contains many pieces of data all of which can change independently resulting in a new value
   * produced, as a result it is more convenient to [map] this flow into multiple sub flows that
   * "focus" on a subset of the data you care about. e.g.
   *
   * ```kotlin
   * val connections: Flow<Selection<VariantConnection>> = ctrl.state.map { it.connections }.distinctUntilChanged()
   * val issues: Flow<Selection<Issue>> = ctrl.state.filters.map { it.issues }.distinctUntilChanged() }
   * val selectedIssue: Flow<Issue?> = issues.mapReady { it.selected }.readyOrNull()
   * ```
