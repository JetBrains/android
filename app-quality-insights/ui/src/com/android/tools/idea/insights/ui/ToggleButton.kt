/**
 * A toggle button that can open/close a given issue.
 *
 * It always keeps the state up to date by using the [withIssue] callback(i.e. every time the issue
 * changes, any registered [withIssue] callbacks will be executed).
 *
 * [withIssue] is most likely going to be implemented via a flow collector in an arbitrary scope,
 * the reason [withIssue] is used here is that it avoids having to pass in both the
 * [kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow] and the [kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope] which makes using and
 * testing it easier.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val button = ToggleButton(
 *   withIssue = { block ->
 *     myScope.launch { myFlow.collect(block) }
 *   },
 *   onOpen = { issue -> open(issue) },
 *   onClose = { issue -> close(issue) }
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * @param withIssue executes registered callbacks when the issue changes.
 * @param onOpen executes whenever the issue is closed by the button click.
 * @param onClose executes whenever the issue is opened by the button click.
