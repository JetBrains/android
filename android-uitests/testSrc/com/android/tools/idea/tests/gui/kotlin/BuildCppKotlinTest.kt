  /**
   * Verifies new project with Kotlin and C++ support can be built
   *
   * This is run to qualify releases. Please involve the test team in substantial changes.
   *
   * This test is a part of the test case with identifier
   * 4d4c36b0-23a7-4f16-9293-061e2fb1310f. This test case was too large, so it has been
   * split into smaller automated tests. Please search for other usages of
   * 4d4c36b0-23a7-4f16-9293-061e2fb1310f to find other test cases that are a part of
   * this test case.
   *
   * The other known test cases of this test case are:
   * * [CreateCppKotlinProjectTest.createCppKotlinProject]
   *
   * TT ID: 4d4c36b0-23a7-4f16-9293-061e2fb1310f
   *
   * Test Steps:
   *   1. Create a basic Kotlin project following the default steps.
   *   2. Select the "include Kotlin" and "C++" support checkbox [verify 1 & 2].
   *   3. Build and run project on an emulator, and verify step 3.
   *
   *   Verification steps:
   *   1. Check if build is successful.
   *   2. C++ code is created, MainActivity has .kt extension.
   *
   * This particular automated test just imports the pre-created project "CppKotlin"
   * created from following the flow for creating new C++ and Kotlin projects.
   * The test then builds the project to see if the project can be built
   * successfully.
