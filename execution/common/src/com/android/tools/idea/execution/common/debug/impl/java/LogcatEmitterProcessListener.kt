/**
 * A [ProcessListener] that emits available text directly to the devices Logcat by invoking `android.util.Log.i()` in the process virtual
 * machine.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to emit text logged by breakpoints to the device Logcat. Normally, this text is only emitted to the debug
 * console. The text is emitted using [ProcessListener.onTextAvailable], so we intercept this callback and try to invoke
 * `android.util.Log.i()` on the process virtual machine.
 *
 * Note that [ProcessListener.onTextAvailable] is called from other places as well. Most notably, it's called to log the
 * `Connected to the target VM` and `Disconnected from the target VM` but there are other cases too.
 *
 * We make a best-effort attempt to emit the text to the devices Logcat. If we can't get an `EvaluationContext` from the process, we abort
 * silently. This can happen when `onTextAvailable` is called while the process is not in the proper state, for example, the
 * `connect/disconnect` messages above will not get logged because there won't be `context`.
 *
 * If we get any kind of exception while attempting to invoke the logger on the process VM, we log the exception at `DEBUG` level. There's
 * no need to log at a higher level since this can happen under normal operation, for example, the process terminates while we are in the
 * middle of this function.
 *
 * Note that this only works for Java/Kotlin debugging. Native (JNI) also have logging breakpoints but use a different mechanism to emit
 * them to the console.
