/**
 * Entry point for Studio Bot functionality from android plugin. It mainly serves as a level of
 * indirection allowing the android plugin to not directly depend on Studio Bot.
 *
 * Before using Studio Bot APIs, you should first check if it is available by invoking
 * [isAvailable].
 *
 * Studio Bot currently provides two main entry points: You can use [chat] to get access to the
 * [ChatService]. Any calls made through this service will show the data being sent to and received
 * from the backend in the Studio Bot chat window. If you do not want to have your queries displayed
 * in the chat window, then use the [model] API to get access to the raw language model. In this
 * case, you are expected to prompt the model appropriately.
 *
 * No matter which API you use, it is important that project specific details are not included in
 * the prompts. See [AiExcludeService] and [isContextAllowed] for more details.
