/**
 * [Expander]s enable the HeapGraph to provide a level of abstraction over the raw object reference
 * graph.
 *
 * When [HeapGraph]s are constructed, only their roots are specified. Expanding a [Node] is the act
 * of determining the objects it references, and creating child Nodes and labeled [Edge]s for them.
 * The whole graph may be expanded by [HeapGraph.expandWholeGraph], which expands Nodes in breadth-
 * first order.
 *
 * On intermediate iterations of a test run with BLeak, however, most of the graph is irrelevant:
 * only the paths from roots to relatively few objects are of interest.
 * [Expander.expandCorrespondingEdge] can be used to take an Edge from an existing graph and
 * expand just the "corresponding" edge in this graph. Typically implemented with the aid of data
 * stored in the Edge's [Label], the nature of this correspondence is one of the key defining
 * features of an Expander. [getChildForLabel] finds the referent of an outgoing edge whose label
 * matches the one provided. Subclasses should ensure that if n1 = expandCorrespondingEdge(n, e),
 * then getChildForLabel(n, e.label) == n1 to avoid inconsistency.
