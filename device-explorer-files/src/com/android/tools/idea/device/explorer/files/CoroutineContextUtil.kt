/**
 * Executes the block in a write-safe scope in the current modality state.
 *
 * If this is called from a non-EDT thread, the "current" modality state cannot be observed, and
 * thus directly using the uiThread context results in the NON_MODAL state being used, preventing
 * execution until modal dialogs complete (see [ModalityState.defaultModalityState]).
 *
 * Thus, this first uses [ModalityState.any()] to transfer control to the EDT, allowing us to access
 * the current modality state, and then invokes the block with that modality state.
 *
 * We cannot just stay in [ModalityState.any()], because accessing VFS, PSI, etc. is not allowed
 * (see [ModalityState.any]).
